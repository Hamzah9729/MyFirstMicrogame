# MyFirstMicrogame
Project Title: "FPS Microgame" 

Description: My game is an FPS game where your objective is to defeat all five robot enemies. There ae 3 bosses and 2 regular robots. There are also two other weapons that you can get if you kill one of the bosses. 

Setup Instructions: There is no setup required for this game. 

Reflection: My game was orginially supposed to be a go karting game, but it wouldn't save so I had to finish this game in one day. I didn't encounter troubles when making this game as everything went pretty smoothly. I learned that if you know your way around Unity, it is an easy game software to use.

Comment: I was going to do the go kart microgame but it didn't work, so you told me to only put one screenshot in for this game.
